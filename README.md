# SiteWhere Administrative User Interface

The SiteWhere Administrative UI is an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application that
provides management features for remote SiteWhere instances. As of SiteWhere 2.0.0, this
application is the preferred method of administering a SiteWhere instance and the embedded
web application is being deprecated.

## Build and run the application

```console
yarn install
yarn run electron:serve
```
